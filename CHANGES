  id3-imges.c: prefix filenames of extract images with the path of the mp3
    file they orginated from ("file.mp3:cover.jp3")

2015-364 (W52):
  main.cpp: [cli change] -s/-u/-E also work without preceding -1/-2/-3;
    these switches will then apply to all tags (where relevant).
    note that -E is already the default for ID3v2/Lyrics3 in this case.

    without read access; also fixes a segfault if cwd wasn't readable

2015-336 (W49):
  ?etid3v2.cpp: [bugfixes] frames being written by -wCOMM:xxxx lacked a
    language field, potentially producing invalidly formatted frames;
    fixed behaviour in presence of multiple COMM frames;
    fix behaviour with Unicode characters in TXXX/COMM:xxxx tags

2015-335 (W49):
  id3v2.c: [bugfix] fix check that prevented conversion of ID3v2.4 tags
  set*.cpp: tighter error checking; should produce more warnings

    'make install-full' or 'make install bash_completion'

2015-029 (W05):                                ---------[v0.79]-----------
  main.cpp: [cli change] if no tags are selected (using -1, -2, -3), id3 will
    select the best tag to read from; also, in this case ID3v2 will be
    modified if already present (but not added)
  main.cpp: [cli change] default operation (without options) is now to view
    tag info, instead of `do nothing'.

    descriptors; for example with `id3 -2 -wTXXX:FMPS_Rating 42'
  mass_tag.cpp: allow reading non-standard information with %{TAG}; e.g.
    '%{TMOO}' to get the 'mood' information in ID3v2.3

2015-019 (W04):
  charconv.cpp: use iconv() on platforms that are not __STDC_ISO_10646__ to
    support non-UTF8 locales on *BSD; disable with -DNO_ICONV

  main.cpp: added -D (replace tag by that from a different file)
  other small tweaks, partial i18n outside of Linux

  adapted to use new replacement function; totally empty variables will not
    clobber existing values now; also means -u will truly be 'update'.

2005-362 (W52):
  charconv.*: redesigned character conversion, support for win/dos
  sedit: replacement written; added support for \n, \t, \r and other escape
    sequences. added multiple fallbacks and "%| a || b || c |?" selection

2005-039 (W06):
  sedit.cpp:89: [CLI] "#" prefixes in vars get processed better now: only
    numbers found inside the string will get padded. E.g. [1/5] -> [01/05]
  setid3[v2].cpp: regression: setting dupe fields overrides again

  mp3file.c: wrote mp3 length checking

2005-037 (W05):
  main.cpp:326: [CLI] added -m switch for 'pattern' shorthand. For example,
    id3 -m "%a - %t.mp3" is identical to id3 -a %1 -t %2 "* - *.mp3". Only
    works on recognized variables, so for ex., id3 -m "%s.mp3" is illegal.

2005-035 (W05):
  code cleanup.

  sedit.cpp: removed substitutions that introduced null chars

2005-025 (W04):

  main.cpp: [BUGFIX] ARGH! Since 0.72, id3 crashed on invalid %indexes. I
    had carefully placed range checks in the original varexp, but due to

  Created a unix manpage. (Whew!)

2004-027 (W05):                                ---------[v0.72]-----------
  [CLI] Now supports directory wildcards (e.g. "mp3root/*/*/*_*.mp3")
    Be careful with this, mkay? ;)
  sedit.cpp:capitalize: now handles punctuation properly
    (so it will be "Love's" and "2nd", not "Love'S" and "2Nd")
  sedit.cpp: Added a "%-" modifier (all characters lowercase), and added
    removal of extraneous spaces (suppressed by the "%_" modifier)
  main.cpp: now uses ffindexp for solving wildcard match (see above)

2004-019 (W04):
  (Resumed development)
  varexp.h: added varexp::iterator class
  ffindexp.cpp: fleshed out base algorithm

2003-301 (W44):
  setid3.cpp:clipped_compare: added a more intelligent ID3v1 genre-lookup,
    so saying "alt" and "alternative", "prog.rock" and "progressive rock",
    "fast fusion" and "fast-fusion", "humour" and "humor", "psyche/adelic",
    etc, etc, will all resolve to the correct genre.

  id3v2.c<>fileops.c: split into two components.
  fileops.c: replaced fopentmp with something conceptually simpler.
  makefile: made it somewhat more conformant. id3 is still too basic to
    warrant using autoconf, imo.

2003-296 (W43):                                ---------[v0.71]-----------
  main.cpp:dirvector: reads directory as a whole to avoid order mangling
  main.cpp: added version info to -h, and added verbose mode with timing
  main.cpp:67: now uses posix constant
  setid3:86: [CLI] added "%," as alternative to "%n", "%@" for "%:"
  varexp.cpp:19: no longer copies vectors around.

2003-269 (W39):
  main.cpp  : [CLI CHANGE!] -dFRAME is now -rFRAME to remove possible
    confusion when -d is used as a stacked parameter.
  id3v2.c:87: encapsulated tmpname handling in fopentmp(), added code that
    uses mktemp() to make id3v2 tag handling _much_ faster.

2003-267 (W39):
  setid3.cpp:38: made freshly written ID3v1 tags have an empty genre.
  id3v2.c:307  : don't rewrite files with no ID3v2 tags when removing
    ID3v2 tags from files.

2003-262 (W38):
  (Resumed development)
  main.cpp: [CLI CHANGE!] implemented command stacking, so
    '-nat Track Artist Title' == '-n Track -a Artist -t Title'

2003-218 (W32):                                ---------[v0.70]-----------
  id3v2.c:ID3_writef: [BUGFIX] Serious. tmpnam() does not guarantee to
    create filenames that can always be fed to rename() on all systems,
    thus causing files to disappear / remain in your temp dir.
    Fix: Added a copy routine/handler.
  setid3.cpp & setid3v2.cpp: now throw exceptions on serious errors
  varexp.h: better explanation of index-out-of-range error
  main.cpp: handles all exceptions, more consistent help messages

2003-216 (W32):
  id3v2.c: added check on tmpnam(0) returning NULL
  id3v2.c:66:  added safety to see if copyfile() halted because of eof
  setid3v2.cpp: [BUGFIX] Harmless. w_ptr constructor sometimes got an
    uninitialized allocation value (went by unnoticed because of
    alloc-on-write?). Fix: Removed this feature - unnecessary anyway.
  setid3v2.cpp: only read previous ID3v2 if necessary.

2003-198 (W29):
  added conditional stdint.h include, some dirent.h implementations need it

2003-189 (W28):                                ---------[v0.60]-----------
  First public release
  setid3.cpp: removed silly packing check
  setid3v2.cpp: added "&& src". Whoopsee! :)
  id3v2.c: writef() now writes ID3v2 tags to files < 10 bytes. :)

2003-185 (W27):
  setid3v2.cpp: made w_ptr a live object + added bad_alloc checks
  setid3v2.cpp: void* src + ID3_free -> voidp<> src (exception safety)
  setid3.cpp: Now emits CR/LF pairs for %n, violating ID3v2, but
    conforming to Winamp. I figure more people care about Winamp.

2003-184 (W27):
  Readme
  Added specifying genre per number

2003-183 (W27):
  Started changelog.
  Install
  More code cleaning. Removed implementation-dependency with rename()

2003-181 (W27):
  Code clean up + minor improvements (e.g. added [] to wildcard match)
  Bolted together (private) `id3' & (private) ID3v2 sources

Todo list:

  - Reading MP3 data (Bitrate, length, etc. Half done.)
  - Cross-directory renaming/moving
  - More things:
    + Support for Ogg Vorbis
    + Support for APEv2
  - Enable multibyte encodings for varexp?
  - Extend substitution capabilities (i/o? slice?)

Thanks go out to everybody who has responded with questions, suggestions,
and bug reports!
