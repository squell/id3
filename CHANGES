Changelog for 'id3'.

2005-305 (W44):
  setid3v2.cpp: rewrote binarize (using shared categorisations)
  getid3v2.cpp: rewrote unbinarize, and reading ID3v2.2
  sedit.cpp: underscores prevented capitalization
  fileops.c: added mvfile(), which honours hard and sym links
  id3v2.c: replaced lightning-stricken part with calls to mvfile()

2005-299 (W43):
  id3v2.c: added transparant support for id3v2.2 tags (iTunes default)

2005-198 (W28):                                ---------[v0.76]-----------
  id3v2.c:177: [bug] fixed another class of id3v2 rejections (sigh)

2005-187 (W27):
  main.cpp:136: [bug] %x could get incremented more than once for each file
  code cleanup/redesign

2005-060 (W09):
  id3v2.c:128:[bug] since v0.75, rejected id3v2 tags w/o padding

2005-039 (W06):
  sedit.cpp:89: [CLI] "#" prefixes in vars get processed better now: only
    numbers found inside the string will get padded. E.g. [1/5] -> [01/05]
  setid3[v2].cpp: regression: setting dupe fields overrides again
  fileexp.cpp:110: optimized speed for cases where the shell has handled
    wildcards (saves sorting and scanning a whole dir for each file)
  fileexp.cpp:132: [CLI] added -R for recursive directory search
  mp3file.c: wrote mp3 length checking

2005-037 (W05):
  main.cpp:326: [CLI] added -m switch for 'pattern' shorthand. For example,
    id3 -m "%a - %t.mp3" is identical to id3 -a %1 -t %2 "* - *.mp3". Only
    works on recognized variables, so for ex., id3 -m "%s.mp3" is illegal.

2005-035 (W05):
  code cleanup.

2005-034 (W05):                                ---------[v0.75]-----------

  setfname.cpp: empty vars get substituted by 'Unknown' (by default)
  id3v2.c:129: [BUGFIX] out of bounds access on illegal id3v2 tags
    ironically, that routine was supposed to catch illegal id3v2 tags...
  ffindexp.cpp:94: now sorts file list (wasn't necessary previously)
  sedit.cpp: [CLI] added %||v fallback, and grouping (kept disabled)

2005-031 (W05):
  getid3[v2].cpp: added
  main.cpp: [CLI] added substitution of %t, %a, %n, %l, %y, %c, %g, %x
  main.cpp: [CLI] enabled -! and -f switch
  sedit.cpp: removed substitutions that introduced null chars

2005-025 (W04):
  setid3v2.cpp: [BUGFIX] v2 tag contents weren't written if using a user
    specified locale. Also -wPCNT listens to vars now.
  setecho: [CLI] Added very primitive tag info display (-q switch)
  charconv: Implemented cvtstring system for conversion.
  sedit: string_parm adapted to use cvtstring
  sedit: now filters control characters from substituted variables

  main.cpp: [BUGFIX] ARGH! Since 0.72, id3 crashed on invalid %indexes. I
    had carefully placed range checks in the original varexp, but due to
    later mod's, the original varexp [] didn't get called anymore. #$()*#

2004-171 (W25):
  sedit.cpp: [BUGFIX] conversion to latin1 gets used correctly now
  sedit.cpp: removed deprecated stuff

2004-170 (W25):
  setid3v2.cpp: [CLI] free form id3v2 tags get processed now
    knows T???, W???, COMM, IPLS, USLT, USER and PCNT frames

2004-167 (W25):
  setfname: created file rename implementation

  makefile deGNUified (mostly), some size optimizations

2004-053 (W08):
  Replaced smartID3 functionality with something more extensible.

2004-030 (W05):
  Added a lot of makefile fluff (install-full, dist, dist-zip)
  main.cpp:178: made options case sensitive

2004-029 (W05):
  Created a unix manpage. (Whew!)

2004-027 (W05):                                ---------[v0.72]-----------
  [CLI] Now supports directory wildcards (e.g. "mp3root/*/*/*_*.mp3")
    Be careful with this, mkay? ;)
  sedit.cpp:capitalize: now handles punctuation properly
    (so it will be "Love's" and "2nd", not "Love'S" and "2Nd")
  sedit.cpp: Added a "%-" modifier (all characters lowercase), and added
    removal of extraneous spaces (suppressed by the "%_" modifier)
  main.cpp: now uses ffindexp for solving wildcard match (see above)

2004-019 (W04):
  (Resumed development)
  varexp.h: added varexp::iterator class
  ffindexp.cpp: fleshed out base algorithm

2003-301 (W44):
  setid3.cpp:clipped_compare: added a more intelligent ID3v1 genre-lookup,
    so saying "alt" and "alternative", "prog.rock" and "progressive rock",
    "fast fusion" and "fast-fusion", "humour" and "humor", "psyche/adelic",
    etc, etc, will all resolve to the correct genre.
  setid3.cpp<>sedit.cpp: made smartID3::edit an independent function

2003-299 (W43):
  main:cpp: error messages to stderr instead of stdout, program now gives
    meaningful result codes.

  id3v2.c<>fileops.c: split into two components.
  fileops.c: replaced fopentmp with something conceptually simpler.
  makefile: made it somewhat more conformant. id3 is still too basic to
    warrant using autoconf, imo.

2003-296 (W43):                                ---------[v0.71]-----------
  main.cpp:dirvector: reads directory as a whole to avoid order mangling
  main.cpp: added version info to -h, and added verbose mode with timing
  main.cpp:67: now uses posix constant
  setid3:86: [CLI] added "%," as alternative to "%n", "%@" for "%:"
  varexp.cpp:19: no longer copies vectors around.
  Updated documentation

2003-269 (W39):
  main.cpp  : [CLI CHANGE!] -dFRAME is now -rFRAME to remove possible
    confusion when -d is used as a stacked parameter.
  id3v2.c:87: encapsulated tmpname handling in fopentmp(), added code that
    uses mktemp() to make id3v2 tag handling _much_ faster.

2003-267 (W39):
  setid3.cpp:38: made freshly written ID3v1 tags have an empty genre.
  id3v2.c:307  : don't rewrite files with no ID3v2 tags when removing
    ID3v2 tags from files.

2003-262 (W38):
  (Resumed development)
  main.cpp: [CLI CHANGE!] implemented command stacking, so
    '-nat Track Artist Title' == '-n Track -a Artist -t Title'

2003-218 (W32):                                ---------[v0.70]-----------
  id3v2.c:ID3_writef: [BUGFIX] Serious. tmpnam() does not guarantee to
    create filenames that can always be fed to rename() on all systems,
    thus causing files to disappear / remain in your temp dir.
    Fix: Added a copy routine/handler.
  setid3.cpp & setid3v2.cpp: now throw exceptions on serious errors
  varexp.h: better explanation of index-out-of-range error
  main.cpp: handles all exceptions, more consistent help messages

2003-216 (W32):
  id3v2.c: added check on tmpnam(0) returning NULL
  id3v2.c:66:  added safety to see if copyfile() halted because of eof
  setid3v2.cpp: [BUGFIX] Harmless. w_ptr constructor sometimes got an
    uninitialized allocation value (went by unnoticed because of
    alloc-on-write?). Fix: Removed this feature - unnecessary anyway.
  setid3v2.cpp: only read previous ID3v2 if necessary.

2003-198 (W29):
  added conditional stdint.h include, some dirent.h implementations need it

2003-189 (W28):                                ---------[v0.60]-----------
  First public release
  setid3.cpp: removed silly packing check
  setid3v2.cpp: added "&& src". Whoopsee! :)
  id3v2.c: writef() now writes ID3v2 tags to files < 10 bytes. :)

2003-185 (W27):
  setid3v2.cpp: made w_ptr a live object + added bad_alloc checks
  setid3v2.cpp: void* src + ID3_free -> voidp<> src (exception safety)
  setid3.cpp: Now emits CR/LF pairs for %n, violating ID3v2, but
    conforming to Winamp. I figure more people care about Winamp.

2003-184 (W27):
  Readme
  Added specifying genre per number

2003-183 (W27):
  Started changelog.
  Install
  More code cleaning. Removed implementation-dependency with rename()

2003-181 (W27):
  Code clean up + minor improvements (e.g. added [] to wildcard match)
  Bolted together (private) `id3' & (private) ID3v2 sources

Todo list:

  - Document %F (Unless it becomes %p)
  - Reading MP3 data (Bitrate, length, etc. Half done.)
  - Cross-directory renaming/moving
  - Conditional expressions
  - Long options
  - More things:
    + Support for Ogg Vorbis
    + Support for APEv2
    + Support for Lyrics3 v2.0 (no priority)
  - Internationalization (Unicode)
    + Add support for UTF16 in ID3v2
    + Enable multibyte encodings for varexp (no priority)
  - Tag handling(/removal) for ID3v2 prior 3
  - Extend substitution capabilities (i/o? slice?)
  - User configurable switches (.rc file?)

Thanks go out to everybody who has responded with questions, suggestions,
and bug reports!
