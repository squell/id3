-------------------------------------------------------------

All files in this package are copyrighted. This is NOT public domain software.

This software comes under a FreeBSD style license, which (in short) means you
can pretty much do with it as you please (including redistribution under
another license such as the GNU GPL), as long as copyright is acknowledged.

It also means you can't sue me if anything terrible happens.

For the actual licensing conditions you should read the file 'COPYING',
which should be included in this source distribution.

| building and installing using a package manager
-------------------------------------------------------------

Files are included for building packages for .deb and .rpm-based Linux 
distributions, and FreeBSD. The package will identify itself as `id3mtag'.

* .deb (Debian/Ubuntu)

From the source tree, run:
> dpkg-buildpackage -b

This should create a .deb file in the parent directory.

* .rpm (Fedora/CentOS)

The simplest way is to simply run:
> rpmbuild -ta id3-0.80.tar.gz

Then look in your RPM build area ($HOME/rpmbuild)

* FreeBSD

Install audio/id3mtag from the ports collection.

---------------------------------------------------------------
| building and installing manually
-------------------------------------------------------------

Successfully compiled with (non-exhaustive list):

 - GCC 4.x, 5.0
 - Clang 3.x
 - Microsoft C/C++ 16.x/18.x
 - Borland/Embarcadero C++ 5.5/6.90
 - Oracle/Sun C++ 5.13, using STLport4
 - Intel C++ 14.0.2

This program is written to be portable, assuming at least a C90 and C++03
compiler and a POSIX:2001 environment. Compilation shouldn't be hard.

Notes for building under Windows:

 * When using MSVC, the file 'dirent.h' is not included with the compiler. You
   can use the open source replacement by Toni Ronkko, obtainable at 
   https://github.com/tronkko/dirent/

 * With MinGW, you need to add LDFLAGS="-static-libgcc -static-libstdc++" to
   the mingw32-make commandline if you want to execute the resulting binary
   on a machine without MinGW installed.

===
Makefiles

Pick the makefile you need and rename it to 'makefile' or use 'make -f':

  'makefile'  is meant for generic GNU/BSD systems. You can also use this
  file for building with Cygwin or MinGW.

  Please note that CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS/LDFLAGS set in your environment will
  override the default (recommended) flags provided in this makefile.

  'makefile.dj'  is for DOS systems using DJGPP v2

  'makefile.nmk'  is for building a Win32 executable with VisualStudio `nmake'

  'makefile.bcc'  is for building a Win32 executable with C++Builder `make'

===
Standard makefile targets:

 make                 - builds the program
 make clean           - removes all files produced by make

Generic GNU/BSD makefile targets & variables:

 make install         - installs the program
 make install-strip   - like install, but strips executable of debug info
 make install-full    - also installs the documentation in $(datadir)/doc
 make uninstall       - uninstall (does not remove documentation)
 make bash_completion - installs the bash completion support
 make help            - lists all makefile targets and variables

Because id3 does not have a configure script (yet), you can set
these variables only on the 'make' commandline:

 prefix               - the prefix directory       (def. "/usr/local")
 bindir               - dir for binaries           (def. "$(prefix)/bin")
 mandir               - dir for manpages           (def. "$(prefix)/man")
 datadir              - dir for shared files       (def. "$(prefix)/share")
 binary               - the binary to install      (def. "id3")
 DESTDIR              - used for staged installs   (def. "")

E.g: "make install prefix=$HOME" to install in $HOME/bin instead. See inside
'makefile' or try `make help' for more details (and more variables).
