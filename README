       id3 mass tagger is a tool for manipulating id3 and id3v2 tags in multi-
       ple files. It can generate tag fields from the filename and other vari-
       ables, and/or rename files, using an intuitive syntax.

       id3  currently  supports  the  old-style  ID3  format with track-number
       extension (ID3 v1.1), as  well  as  the	more  complicated  ID3v2  (ID3
       v2.2.0,	v2.3.0) format.  This also means use is pretty much limited to
       audio files which use these formats, e.g, MPEG-1 Layer III.

       Order of the options is only important where specified.

       filespec ...
	      specifies the file(s) to be affected by the command.

	      If you use wildcards, it is STRONGLY recommended to enclose  the
	      specification  in  double  quotes  ("").	id3 has internal shell
	      pattern matching which will not work if your shell also performs
	      this function.

	      The shell pattern matching can be applied to both file names and
	      directory names.

       -h     show commandline help

       -V     display version number and copyright

       -v     be verbose

       -M     preserve last modification time of files operated on

       -1     process ID3v1 tags (default). See `-2'.

       -2     process ID3v2 tags. If both `-1' and `-2'  are  specified,  both
	      tag formats are selected.

       -d     do  not  re-use  existing tag data. If no new tag information is
	      specified in conjunction with this  option,  all	selected  tags
	      will be removed.

       -t title
       -a artist
       -l album
       -n tracknr
       -y year
       -g genre
       -c comment

	      add/replace  the	specified fields in all selected tags with the
	      values given. Field values are scanned  for  substitution  vari-
	      ables,  see  SUBSTITUTION  below.  If  a field value is a single
	      variable, and its substitution fails, no operation is performed.

	      Genres  can  be specified either directly or with their assigned
	      number, regardless of tag format.

       -f filename-template
	      rename files encountered according  to  filename-template.   The
	      argument	is  scanned for substitution variables. An empty vari-
	      able will by default get replaced  with  "Unknown".   Trying  to
	      rename to an already existing file will cause an error.

       -q format
	      for each file encountered, format will get scanned for substitu-
	      tion variables, and  written  to	standard  output.  Using  this
	      option will block any attempt to modify files.

       -m     match  mode;  interpret  any  variables found in a filespec as a
	      wildcard, and set the tag field  corresponding  to  the  matched
	      wildcard.     Thus,   `-m "%a - %t.mp3"'	 is   equivalent   for
	      `-a %1 -t %2 "* - *.mp3"'.  This option is  merely  a  shorthand
	      and  does  not add any intelligence; in particular, any variable
	      interpreted still counts as a wildcard, see SUBSTITUTION	below.

       -D filename
	      duplicate  and  copy  the  tags  found in filename to the target
	      files The tag in each file is replaced after any variables  have
	      been  read,  but before any fields are updated. Any original tag
	      values not explicitly copied to the new  tag  (for  example,  by
	      using  -u)  are  lost.  If filename does not have any tags, this
	      option is identical to the -d option.

       -R pattern
	      search the directory hierarchy rooted at each filespec for files
	      whose  relative path matches pattern. If no filespec\fR are sup-
	      plied, starts searching in the current directory.  Wildcards  in
	      pattern  do  not treat `.' or `/' specially when performing this
	      search, so `./t*.mp3' matches `/test/misc/foo.mp3'.  Using  this
	      option also affects variable substitution, see

       --     force  the  following  argument to be interpreted as a filename.
	      Use this for files that start with a `-'	(dash).   SUBSTITUTION
	      below.

       The  following  options	only  apply  on the tag most recently selected
       before them, and only have meaning where relevant.

       -u     update all standard tag fields by copying them from  the	source
	      tag. This is similar to writing `-talnygc %t %a %l %n %y %g %c',
	      but only operates on the most recent tag. It is possible for the
	      source and destination tag to be the same.

       -s size
	      try to write a new tag using exactly size bytes, adding / remov-
	      ing padding as necessary. The resulting tag will have no padding
	      if size is smaller than the actual size necessary.

       -rFRAME
	      remove  all occurrences of frames named FRAME from the tag. Con-
	      sult the format documentation for valid FRAME names.

       -wFRAME data
	      add / update a frame named FRAME with data in the  tag.  data is
	      scanned  for  substitution  variables. Again, consult the format
	      documentation. See COMPATIBILITY for more information.

       Individual options can be stacked in a single argument for more	conve-
       nience.	For example, running

	  id3 -2d -alt "Artist" "Album" "Title" *.mp3

       is equivalent to:

	  id3 -2 -d -a "Artist" -l "Album" -t "Title" *.mp3

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       id3 can perform "printf-like" substitution on the values prior to writ-
       ing them to a tag. Note that if you want to use pattern	matching,  you
       HAVE TO enclose the wildcard specification on the commandline in double
       quotes to prevent your shell from expanding any wildcards.

       \c     escape sequence. \n, \r, \t, \v, \f, \b, \a, get replaced as  in
	      C,  any other character will be stripped of any special meaning.
	      E.g., \n becomes the newline character, \\ a single backslash.

       %<modifiers>N
	      where N <- [0..9] replaced with the portion  of  the  file  path
	      matching	the nth `*' (asterisk) wildcard in the file specifica-
	      tion. 0 is taken to mean 10.  If	the  `-R  pattern'  option  is
	      used, the file path is matched against pattern instead.

       %<modifiers>c
	      where c <- [a..z]
	      replaced by values according to the following table:

	      %t title
	      %a artist
	      %l album title
	      %n track number
	      %y year
	      %g genre
	      %c comment field
	      %f file name (without path)
	      %p path to filename
	      %x auto-increasing counter
	      %X file counter

	      Values get read (where applicable) from the source tag, which is
	      the left-most tag selected on the command line, and reflect  the
	      state  of  the  file  before any modifications were made. If the
	      source value is not available, the variable  fails.   %p%f  com-
	      bines  to  the  full  path  and  file  name.  The  %x value gets
	      increased every time it has been	substituted  inside  the  same
	      directory,  and is intended for auto-numbering. %X increases for
	      every file processed.

       %%     replaced with a single "%", equivalent to \%

       %|text||alt text||...|?
	      substituted by the first text that was completely successful, or
	      fails  as  empty,  see  fall-backs below. This can be used as an
	      all-or-nothing substitution. A lone "%?" always fails.

   Available <modifiers> (optional):
       + (plus sign)
	      Capitalize the substituted value

       - (minus sign)
	      Convert all characters to lowercase

       _ (underscore)
	      Do not replace underscores with  spaces,	and  do  not  compress
	      empty space.

       # (hash or pound sign)
	      Pad  all	numeric values within the substituted value, if neces-
	      sary.  Multiple hash signs can be stacked  to  increase  desired
	      width.  If  there  are  no  numeric values, this modifier has no
	      effect.

       |fall-back|
	      If substitution for a variable fails, attempt fall-back instead.
	      fall-back  itself  may  be  empty  or  contain  other  variables
	      (including other fall-backs). If	fall-back  contains  variables
	      that  fail,  the	fall-back  fails and will not be used. If more
	      than one fall-back is provided, successive fall-backs are  tried
	      until one succeeds.

       Here are some examples of using id3:

       id3 -a "Stallman" -t "Free Software Song" fs_song.mp3"
	      Add a simple tag to a file.

       id3 -d *.mp3
	      Removes all ID3v1 tags from all mp3's.

       id3 -2 -1u fs_song.mp3
	      Copy ID3v2 tag to ID3v1 tag in selected file.

       id3 -D source.mp3 -1 -2 dest.mp3
	      Duplicate ID3v1 and ID3v2 tags of source.mp3

       id3 -a "TAFKAT" -n "%1" -t "%+2" "*. *.mp3"
	      Update tag fields similar to this;
		-a "TAFKAT" -n "01" -t "My Song"  "01. my_song.mp3"
		-a "TAFKAT" -n "02" -t "Untitled" "02. untitled.mp3"

       id3 -2 -f "%a - %t.mp3" blaet.mp3
	      Rename file to a standard format, using ID3v2 values.

       id3 -a %t -t %a "*.mp3"
	      Swap artist and title fields in all mp3's.

       id3 -2 -rAPIC -s 0 *.mp3
	      Removes embedded images and padding from all mp3's.

       id3 -2d -u *.mp3
	      Rewrite ID3v2 tag while keeping only the basic fields.

       id3 -2 -wUSLT "foo, bar0alala!0 blaet.mp3
	      Adds an ID3v2 lyric frame to blaet.mp3.

       id3 -v -g alt-rock -alnt "The Author" %1 %2 %3 "Author - */(*) *.mp3"
	      Process multiple directories at once.

       id3 -v -g alt-rock -a "The Author" -m "Author - %l/(%n) %t.mp3"
	      Shorthand for the previous example.

       id3 -2 -c "Was: %_f" -f "%|Nobody|a - %|Untitled (%x)|t.mp3" "*.mp3"
	      Advanced rename. Saves previous filename in the comment field.

       id3 -2 -q "%| %a - %|Untitled|t || %t || %1 |?" "*.mp3"
	      Generate a playlist.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       The  internal  pattern matching emulates the normal pattern matching of
       "sh". It supports ?, * and [].

       A shell pattern will never match a forward slash ("/") or a  dot  (".")
       beginning a filename. Wildcards can be used for directories as well (to
       arbitrary depths), in which case a search will be performed.

       In an ambiguous situation, the pattern matcher will  always  resolve  a
       "*"  wildcard to the shortest possible sequence of tokens. This differs
       from the behavior of regular expressions,  however  it  tends  to  make
       sense in the context of filenames.

       Do NOT add ID3 tags to files for which it does not make sense, i.e, add
       them only to MP3 files. In particular, do not add  ID3v2  tags  to  Ogg
       files, since ID3v2 tags start at the beginning of the file.

       id3 has a built-in genre list of 148 genres. If you pass the -g parame-
       ter a string instead of a number when using ID3v1, id3  tries  to  find
       the  specified  genre  in  this	list, and selects the closest possible
       match (if any). For the genre numbers and exact spelling,  see  id3v1.c
       in  the	source distribution. An empty or invalid genre is assigned the
       number 0.

       id3 automatically writes Unicode tags  where  necessary.  Depending  on
       your  system, you may only be able to fully work with all characters if
       you are using an UTF-8 locale.

       id3 will write the ID3v2 tag version that was encountered and does  not
       convert	from  one version to another. If no existing tag is found, ID3
       v2.3 will be written (this may change in a future version).

       The  -wFRAME  parameter	only  knows  the  following  ID3v2.2  (3  let-
       ter)/ID3v2.3  (4  letter)  frames:  T??/T???  (text), W??/W??? (links),
       COM/COMM (comment), IPL/IPLS  (involved	 people),  ULT/USLT  (lyrics),
       CNT/PCNT (numeric play counter) and USER (tos, v2.3 only).  Frames that
       do not match the tag type encountered are ignored and not converted. It
       is a no-op for ID3v1.

       id3 does not (currently) support ID3v2 v4.0 tags. It also does not sup-
       port ID3v2 features as compression, encryption, ...
